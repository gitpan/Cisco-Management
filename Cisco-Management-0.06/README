Cisco-Management version 0.06
=============================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

CAVEATS

As of version 0.06, Cisco::Management supports IPv6 on systems with IPv6 
configured but requires Socket version 1.94 or greater.  This may cause 
issues on Perl versions less than 5.14, where the default Socket module 
is of a lesser version.  The requirement stems from the use of the 
getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() functions not available on older 
versions of Socket.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Socket (requires 1.94 for IPv6)
  Sys::Hostname
  Net::SNMP
  Net::IPv6Addr
  Test::Simple
