Cisco-Management
================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

IMPORTANT NOTE

Version 0.08 will the last in this line of support.  The next version 
will be a complete rewrite separating functions into sub classes allowing 
for quicker and easier development as well as allowing others to 
contribute to the Cisco::Management package.  For the most part, the 
initial release will be 99% backward compatible with several warnings 
for deprecated calls that should be updated to the new API.

IPv6 VERSUS IPv4 ONLY

As of version 0.06, Cisco::Management supports IPv6 on systems with IPv6 
configured but requires Socket version 1.94 or greater.  This may cause 
issues on Perl versions less than 5.14, where the default Socket module 
is of a lesser version.  The requirement stems from the use of the 
getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() functions not available on older 
versions of Socket.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Socket (requires 1.94 for IPv6)
    Net::IPv6Addr (required for IPv6 support in ProxyPing)
  Sys::Hostname
  Net::SNMP
  Test::Simple
