Revision history for Perl extension Cisco::Management.

Version 0.08 will the last in this line of support.  The next version
will be a complete rewrite separating functions into sub classes allowing
for quicker and easier development as well as allowing others to
contribute to the Cisco::Management package.  For the most part, the
initial release will be 99% backward compatible with several warnings
for deprecated calls that should be updated to the new API.
